# Alien-Alphabet
Alien Alphabet Aliens have visited earth and their alphabet is very weird. Its the same 26 letters (A to Z) but in a different order. They want your help to sort a string in the order of their alphabet.

For example, aliens might use the reversed alphabet of "zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba" so when they sort "abc", it becomes "cba" and when they sort "apple" it becomes "pplea". When sorted capital/lowercase letters, the capital letters always come first (e.g. "camelCasE" -> "smlEeCcaa"). You will write a program that reads 2 lines from standard input - the first line is the alien's alphabet (letters a-z, all lowercase) and the second line is the string the aliens want you to sort. Your program will output the sorted string. Examples are provided below.

** Achive below cases without using any library **

Example 1

input line 1 -->> abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz input line 2 -->> cyxbza
output of ex 1--> abcxyz

Example 2

input line 1 -->> zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba input line 2 -->> cyxbza output of ex 1--> zyxcba

Example 3

input line 1 -->> wvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcbaxyz input line 2 -->> camelCasE
output of ex 1--> smlEeCcaa
